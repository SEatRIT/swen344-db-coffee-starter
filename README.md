# Rochester Rooster Roasters

We are a local coffee roasting company with a rigorous, data-driven approach to our craft. Every day, we experiment with new roasts and invite members of the community to come tell us what they think. For a mere $10 per month, coffee reviewers can come by our shop and have a coffee once a day in exchange for filling out a review card. We then crunch that data with our state-of-the-art analytics and deliver the best coffee roasts you've ever tasted.

We call our custom coffee roaster *The Rooster* because it helps thousands of people everywhere wake up every morning. We have a custom configuration system that is tightly integrated with our review system, allowing us to design new coffee roasting curves directly based on feedback.

## Coffee Roasting

A coffee roaster is essentially a giant oven with an **agitator** spinning around to keep the roast even. The **roast curve** is the most essential part of a roasting recipe: it defines what the temperature should be and a which time. Every bean from various different kinds of soil around the world needs a different curve. In addition to that, coffee beans need to **rest** for a period of time after roasting to release various gasses before they are packaged or brewed. We need to track individual roasting curves for each bean delivery, agitator spin rate, and resting time for each roast.

## Review System

Every reviewer is registered in our system. When they get checked in, they are given a random cup of coffee roasted the day before. They then fill out a review of that coffee, along with any comments. Every question uses a Likert scale evaluated against a statement. Those statements are:

* I enjoyed this coffee.
* I am having a nice day thus far.
* This coffee tastes acidic.
* This coffee has a nice mouthfeel.
* This coffee smells nice.
* This coffee is bitter.
* This coffee is sweet.
* This coffee has a nice aftertaste.
